# myCalculator-
HTML/CSS/JS calculator programmed without using eval() function. Operator precedence self programmed.  


This was the final project to the javascript section of webdev101 in the odin project. 

It was my second big odin hill to climb and the first time I programmed something from a more theoretical appraoch i.e. looking up which methods worked with strings vs. arrays, understanding how to use scope of variables , making functions independent of my program etc. rather than just stack over flowing until my program works.

I did not rely on the eval function which does all the work of processing the order of operations ...rather I made a series of functions to do this. 

I learned a lot about organizing code into functions and this was a fun project for me. If the last project showed me i could hack together something that really works, this one showed me I could take a step towards a more systematic design and problem solving approach.
